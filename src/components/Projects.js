If a player chooses to send a gift, they select a sticker from their unlocked stickers which they want to give the player in the gift. The player can also personalize the gift by changing the colour of the gift and ribbon. The playerâ€™s companion, the owl, will deliver the gift to the requester upon sending. In return, the recipient can \"thank\" the sender, by sending a heart, to let them know they appreciate the gift they have received. All gifts received, will end up in the recipient's mailbox. This mailbox can be viewed anytime by the player to look back on received messages. When the player gets a sticker out of a gift that they have not received yet, this sticker will then be permanently unlocked for them to use in future gifts.",
